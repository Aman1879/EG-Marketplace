              Welcome to <strong>Eg MarketPlace</strong>, a platform built with one simple but powerful mission:
            </p>
            <p className="story-highlight">
              to connect Indian buyers and sellers through a seamless, trustworthy, and modern digital marketplace.

              Our story began with a clear vision—to create an online space where every Indian, from a small home-based artisan to an emerging business owner, can showcase their products easily and reach customers across the country. We understood that while ecommerce was growing rapidly, many talented local sellers still lacked the resources, visibility, and support needed to bring their products into the digital India.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time, Indian buyers were searching for a clean, organized, and reliable place to explore categories, discover unique items, and enjoy a smooth shopping experience without confusion or complications.
            </p>
            <p className="story-callout">
              <strong>Eg MarketPlace was created to bridge that gap.</strong>

            <p>
              As we observed online shopping trends, a pattern became clear:

              <div className="story-point">
                <span className="point-icon">🏪</span>
                <p>Vendors were struggling with complicated onboarding processes, limited customer reach, and platforms dominated by big brands.</p>
              </div>
              <div className="story-point">
                <span className="point-icon">🛒</span>
                <p>Buyers wanted a simpler, more personalized, and trustworthy marketplace where they could find genuine products from real Indian sellers.</p>
